# Course Philosophy
## Connecting AI Applications to Low-Level Hardware

---

<->

### 🎯 Our Goal
Build a *solid bridge* between **high-level applications** and the **hardware they run on**.

===  

### 🌉 Visual Metaphor  
> A bridge labeled **"Computer Systems"**  
> linking a ☁️ *cloud* *(Python/AI Apps)*  
> to a 🔩 *silicon wafer* *(CPU/Memory/Hardware)*
